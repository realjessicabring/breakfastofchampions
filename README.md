Jessica you better finish this and make it beautiful

## TO DO
- Put in a nav bar
- Decide site layout
- Hunt bootstrap and try to figure out a freaking theme


## Instructions for updating fields and stuff
1. Add to the model you have, located in models.py 
2. then when you're done you run the following: 

```
python manage.py makemigrations

python manage.py migrate

python manage.py runserver

```
3. This will upload everything to your database and such and update the fields 
4. Check the migrations folder for your new fields and other changes to the model to make sure they have been uploaded correctly


## Where to find everything 
1. The only think we really need to find is the django thingy for admin stuff. This is where you make blog posts and add pictures and such 
2. It is located at: /admin/breakfastofchampions/


## Ideas for writing
- I would like to think up what I will be putting here
- I want to write a blog about maybe MJ Lenderman and why I am so interested in the Asheville music scene, also Karly Hartzman...she's awesome > they broke up > dating your coworker > being a musician
- I would love to talk about North Carolina and why I love it here
- I could definitely talk about being in corporate America and how that is
- Also I am on such a role right now it's great to be coding on my mac again because I am so tired of Windows
- Dude I could write a whole article about IUDs
- I could write a whole article about the Coen Brothers and why I love Francis MacDormand so much and also how Holly Hunter was so perfect in Raising Arizona
- Music reviews, album reviews
- letterboxd in general and maybe I should give them some money and just freaking go pro
