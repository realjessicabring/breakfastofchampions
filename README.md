Jessica you better finish this and make it beautiful


## Here is a change I am testing out
- I would like to think up what I will be putting here
- I want to write a blog about maybe MJ Lenderman and why I am so interested in the Asheville music scene, also Karly Hartzman...she's awesome > they broke up > dating your coworker > being a musician
- I would love to talk about North Carolina and why I love it here
- I could definitely talk about being in corporate America and how that is
- Also I am on such a role right now it's great to be coding on my mac again because I am so tired of Windows
- Dude I could write a whole article about IUDs
- I could write a whole article about the Coen Brothers and why I love Francis MacDormand so much and also how Holly Hunter was so perfect in Raising Arizona
- Music reviews, album reviews
- letterboxd in general and maybe I should give them some money and just freaking go pro
